      School canteen facility aims to provide children of working parents to buy nutritious and healthy food at competitive prices during the school day. Meals are either cooked on the premises or bought from approved restaurants and food outlets. Pupils who cannot take full breakfast from home may bring some form of healthy ‘snack’ with them for break time. Pupils can also buy snacks items and fruits from the snacks counter.

Parents shall send canteen food order slip or coupon through the pupil for availing canteen services.  Payments can be made daily, weekly or monthly. There is a choice of menu that operates on a rota basis during the week. If you would like to learn more about the menu and payment system, please contact the Catering Supervisor.

Parents are requested to consider healthy food options with quantity appropriate to the age and appetite of the student.  Pupils are encouraged to bring and use fork and spoon for their lunch. Parents are advised to send packed lunches covered with a towel.
Pupils may bring water to drink during the day in a clean water bottle. Water dispensers are provided for them to refill their bottles during the day.
​
Fizzy drinks, chewing/bubble gums, etc., are not to be brought to school  at anytime.

    1.When it comes to education, it is one of the most essential pieces to having a successful life in today’s society. And for this reason, there are a large percentage of emphasis placed on schools for this reason alone. In society, people feel that school and education should be taken advantage of and every child should attend school daily with no excuses. It’s a known fact that students who miss consecutive days out of school, tends to fall back in grades as well as learning the classwork at hand. 
    <br>
    2.County government, state government, and the federal government has made laws for states all around the globe pertaining to the number of days students should miss school within a school year’s time. In doing this, it will ensure that students will be accounted for and help them to be successful throughout the school year. By state law, attendance in a public school, private school and home school program is required for children at the ages of six to their sixteenth birthday.
    <br>
    3.I believe that school attendance is solely determined and based on only the parents and the students. In order to get test scores and EOG grades where they need to be, plays a part in attendance as well.
